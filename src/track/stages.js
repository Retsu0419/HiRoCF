/**
 * Stage 3 -- a genuine mountain pass: a switchback climb, a ridge, a
 * hairpin descent and the valley road home.
 *
 * The layout this replaces was a boustrophedon of gentle S-waves joined by
 * 1000-radius U-turns. Nothing in it was tighter than ~520 radius, and at
 * this car's steering rates a 1000-radius corner is taken flat at ~590
 * speed -- so the "touge" had no corner the player ever had to brake for,
 * and the rival's drift, which only arms on a sustained corner, had almost
 * nothing to arm on. It read as a wide serpentine test track.
 *
 * What makes this one a pass instead:
 *
 * - Eight switchback hairpins (six climbing, two on the descent) with
 *   apexes of 330-450 radius. Those numbers come from the car, not from
 *   taste: the player's turn rate gives a grip radius of ~394 at speed 400
 *   and ~647 at 500, and a drift (driftMinSpeed 435 on this stage) tightens
 *   it to ~330 at 435. So a 330-390 apex is exactly the corner you have to
 *   brake to ~400 for, and can drift through if you commit -- which is the
 *   whole point of the stage.
 *
 * - Each hairpin is a COMPOUND corner (see `hairpin` below), not a single
 *   180 arc between two parallel straights. Two reasons, both structural.
 *   The angled entry and exit add their own perpendicular travel, so a 330
 *   apex still leaves ~1050 units between the two legs -- a plain 180 arc
 *   would need a 525 radius for the same spacing, which is no longer a
 *   hairpin. And every piece of it turns the same way with no straight in
 *   between, so the rival's long-curve detector (getLongCurveRamp in
 *   rival.js groups runs of same-signed turning and drops runs shorter than
 *   longCurveMinLen) reads one ~2000-unit corner rather than three short
 *   runs that each fail the test -- with straight legs the AI neither leans
 *   onto its line nor drifts at the hairpins at all.
 *
 * - One long valley straight home (~5300 units, kinked once so it reads as
 *   a road rather than a runway) so there is somewhere to spend the boost
 *   and somewhere to overtake.
 *
 * Closure is SOLVED at build time, not fitted by hand. Two of the lengths
 * (`A`, a due-south straight in the descent, and `B`, the due-west valley
 * road) are left free; every other op is fixed. The end position is affine
 * in both and the two are perpendicular, so walking the layout dry three
 * times gives a 2x2 system whose solution closes the loop exactly. Edit any
 * other leg and the two free lengths re-solve themselves -- the version of
 * this stage that this replaces carried hand-fitted constants, plus a
 * comment recording how many times they had to be re-swept by hand after
 * each change.
 *
 * Geometry is verified in stages.test.js rather than trusted: the loop
 * closes, no two stretches of road further apart along the route than one
 * corner complex come closer than the road's full visual swath
 * (2 * (roadHalf 190 + mountain bands 184) = 748), and the tightest radius
 * anywhere on the built path stays inside what the car can drive.

 *
 * The `approach` arc is deliberately huge (3000 radius) and shallow: it is
