/**
 * Per-point "how committed to the big-corner line should the car be here"
 * value (0..1), by RUN LENGTH of sustained same-direction turning -- not by
 * local curvature. A short, sharp S-curve wiggle has HIGHER local curvature
 * than a long, gentle hairpin sweep (tighter radius = more turn per unit
 * distance), but it's the hairpin/big sweeper that reads as "the big
 * corner" to a driver, precisely because it's held for so long, not because
 * any single point of it is the sharpest.
 *
 * A first version returned a plain 0/1 mask, read by scanning up to 1040
 * units ahead of the car and taking the max -- which meant the moment ANY
 * point that far ahead was "big", the car snapped to full lean/drift right
 * then, even while it was still on an unrelated short curve nowhere near
 * the real corner. That's what read as the short entry/exit curves getting
 * misidentified, and as the car ballooning wide instead of cutting straight
 * to the inside: it was committing too early and too abruptly, so the
 * car's own steering (which can't turn instantly) overshot before catching
 * up.
 *
 * This version returns a continuous ramp instead of a binary flag, and
 * trims the ends of each qualifying run: the middle of the run (inset by
 * `trimLength` from each end) is the true "core" at full commitment (1);
 * outward from each core edge -- both back into the trimmed run ends and
 * out into whatever precedes/follows the run -- the value fades linearly to
 * 0 over `rampLength`. Reading a single value at the car's own position
 * each frame then naturally anticipates the corner (rising as it
 * approaches) and lets go smoothly on exit, with no separate lookahead scan
 * needed at call sites. Computed once per path and cached, like the mask
 * this replaced.
 *
 * Also returns `sign`: which way (+1/-1) THIS run turns, one fixed value
 * for every point the run's ramp touches (core, trimmed ends, and both
 * ramp-in/ramp-out tails). A long hairpin often runs right into a same-
 * direction connector arc that gets merged into the very same run, and that
 * combined run can easily be longer than any short lookahead window -- so
 * recomputing "which way is inside" fresh each frame from a live few-
 * hundred-unit lookahead (the first version of this) would, once the car
 * was far enough into a long run, start sampling past the run's own end
 * into whatever came next. If that next stretch curved the other way, the
 * lookahead's answer would flip sign while the car was still deep inside
 * the ORIGINAL run, well before its commitment (`amount`) had actually
 * decayed -- which is what read as snapping to hug the inside of the wrong,
 * upcoming corner while still exiting the one it was just in. Baking one
 * sign per run at build time, from the run's own direction, means the
 * whole run (ramps included) agrees on which way is inside for as long as
 * `amount` says the car is still committed to it.
