/**
 * Builds the layered road surface for a stage.
 *
 * The "cheap" look of the previous build came from the road being one flat
 * fill with a painted line on it. Here the surface is assembled from stacked
 * ribbons, each with its own material, so the eye reads real construction:
 *
 *   ground → run-off → apron → kerb → asphalt → wear → edge shading → paint
 *
 * Boundary bands are declared as an ordered list of widths growing outward
 * from the road edge, so they can never accidentally overlap and hide each
 * other. Each band overlaps its neighbour by a couple of units to avoid a
 * hairline gap where two meshes meet.

 *
 * On an arm, not on the shoulder. A post standing at the kerb has to sit
 * past the player's reach or it reads as something the car drives through
 * -- and at that distance it falls outside the visible half-width at the
 * player's own row, so the first version of this was invisible in play.
 * Reaching the head out over the road is both what a real signal at a
 * Japanese junction does and the only way it is actually in shot.
 *
 * Which is why it is split in two. The head hangs over the carriageway, so
 * painting it into the road layer put it UNDER the cars and the car drove
 * over the signal -- from directly above, the one thing that reads as is a
 * lamp lying in the road. `paintSignalOverhead` goes into the surface's
 * `overhead` container, which main.js parents above the actors, so the car
 * passes beneath the head exactly as it would in life; `paintSignalShadow`
 * stays down on the road, and the offset between the two is what gives the
 * gantry its height.
